## Roadmap of the day
We will work on a cookbook application during two days (today and Monday). It will be very close to our todo manager, but will manipulate recipes instead of tasks.

#### `01-Cookbook-v0` (Today)
Our cookbook app will be close to our todo-manager but we will add "persistence". Instead of loosing all data when the programs quits (as in our todo-manager), we'll add extra difficulty of CSV storage to keep our recipes. Start with paper and pencils to brainstorm on your architecture before starting to code, and ask for a teacher to validate your architecture!

#### `02-Connected-cookbook` (Monday)
Today, we are going to enhance our cookbook app. We want to get recipes data from the web (marmiton or other food-site), and add features in our app to import this data in our "CSV"-database.
