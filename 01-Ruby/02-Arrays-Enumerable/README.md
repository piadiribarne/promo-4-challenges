## Roadmap of the day

#### `01-Simple-looping`

Simple challenge to sum integers using `while` and `for` loops

**Important**: don't spend too much time on the recursive solution (the 3rd one which is tricky) and go on to the next challenges even if your tests are not 100% green on this.


#### `02-Sorting-the-wagon`

A challenge on basic arrays manipulation, where you have to define an array, append element to this array and then sort it. Try to implement a basic solution first that **does the job**, even if it does not handle special case, or does not display the exact message. That's how developpers work. They build a first solution that works, and **after only they refactor and enhance!**


#### `03-Black-Jack`

A more advanced challenge where you have to build a Black Jack game. It will make you use conditional and looping structures in-depth!

#### `04-Debug-gym`

Some error make this code buggy. Here, do not try to detect it in you source code. Run your ruby script and **READ THE ERROR MESSAGE**. Beginners often don't try to read their errors, but it's a major dev skill!

#### `05-Destructive-method`

A small challenge to make you understand the difference between methods returning copies and methods modifying their receiver.
