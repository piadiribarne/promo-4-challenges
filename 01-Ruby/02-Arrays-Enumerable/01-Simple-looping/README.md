## Background & Objectives

Learn the tree ways to "loop" in ruby:

- With a `for` loop
- With a `while` loop
- With [recursion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6418017/what-is-ruby-recursion-and-how-does-it-work)

## Specs

- Write a method in ruby that computes the sum of the integers between a min value and a max value (min and max included).
- You should at least implement the two simple versions, using `for..end` and `while..end` structures.

## Tips & Resources

- [ruby loops](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm)
- In Ruby, using an `each` iterator is considered more idiomatic than a `for` loop when you want to iterate through a collection. We will see that in the next days.
